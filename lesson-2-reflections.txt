Lesson 2

Start a new repository
Go to the folder with the files and run
>git init
This will only initialize the repository and will NOT create any commits for you

According to the lesson, running git status should tell “Initial commit”. However, on my computer, it tells me
“No commits yet” instead

Stage for commit to the “staging area”
>git add <file>

To de-stage a file, use git reset

For committing, simply run 
>git commit
If the core.editor has been set up properly, it will open the core editor.
As it turned out, my editor Sublime Text, was not properly setup. Adding a symlink to /usr/local/bin/subl did the trick 

I should by the way consider buying a license for Sublime Text. It is per-user and costs $80
