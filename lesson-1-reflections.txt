Using git log and git diff
As a reminder, running git log will show a list of the recent commits with information about them, including commit IDs. Running git diff followed by two commit IDs will compare the two versions of the code in those commits. If you need a refresher, you may want to rewatch this video.
Entering commit IDs
If it is easier, you may enter the first four or more characters of the commit ID rather than pasting the entire ID.

I add this to the back of my own .bash_profile


Setting up Sublime as my default text editor for git commits
Add  
alias subl="/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"
To .bash_profile

This did not work! I instead tested symbolic linking
ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl
http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/getting_started/install.html

Now it works!


Configure the git config
>git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"
>git config --global push.default upstream
>git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
